# forced-type-hints
It basically allows you to force types I mean, using decorator,
the function itself would throw an error if unexpected 
type was given compared with the set typehint on parameter 

### Example
`print('hello world, i'm still learning how to design README.md, be patient please, i will lader add a good one lol')`
